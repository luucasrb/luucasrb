### Hi, my name is Lucas. How are you? ðŸ‘‹

Programming since 2015, I graduated in Computer Engineering from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande in early 2021, and recently completed a Master's degree also in Computer Engineering.

During the latter part of my undergraduate studies and throughout the Master's program, I worked as a Researcher in the development of a analytics tool for the [Petrobras SA](https://petrobras.com.br/). My final dissertation focused on resource and performance analysis in the training of Graph Neural Networks.

Over the last three years, I've also worked as a Full-Stack Engineer at [MBOCHIP](https://mbochip.com/), developing systems and interfaces for the financial market. We are now launching a new system for traders and institutional investors focused on the markets in Brazil, the USA, and India.

Currently, I've been exploring how to build and deploy hybrid Desktop apps (like Tauri and Electron) and also learning about Cloud Computing.

I'm originally from SÃ£o Carlos (SP, Brazil), but I'm currently living in Porto Alegre (RS, Brazil) for work reasons. I also lived in Rio Grande (RS, Brazil) during my undergraduate formation.
In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, series, and animes (**Kimetsu no Yaiba** is my favorite these days). I also like going for walks, runs, checking out the parks in Porto Alegre, and working out at home.
